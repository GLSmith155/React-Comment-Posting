# React-Comment-Posting

This is a web app for practicing the usage of props by creating three components, which includes a reusable accept/reject message component called ApprovalCard, and a resusable comment component called 'CommentDetail.' Both of these components are used as props inside the parent component called App where the user input resides. The image for each user is generated using data from faker.js within the child component 'CommentDetail.' In a real life situation, the CommentDetail component would instead be using a get call to the server where the posters details would reside within a database repository.
